			"description": "ICollab uses **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for secure user authentication. The authentication process relies on **Access Tokens** (temporary tokens for access) and **Refresh Tokens** (used to refresh the Access Token).\n\nUsers can register by manually entering their email and password, or they can use **Google** or **LinkedIn** authentication for a seamless registration or login experience. While users have the option to register or log in through these third-party providers, **authentication will depend entirely on JWT** (Access and Refresh tokens). Once authenticated, all further interactions with the API will rely on the JWT-based stateless authentication.\n\n[Refrence Article](https://medium.com/@itz.dhruv/mastering-oauth-2-0-a-guide-to-access-and-refresh-tokens-c79ab72d2df9)"
